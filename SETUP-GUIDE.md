- [x] Branch renamed to `main`

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

Since you already have the GitHub new repository page open (`https://github.com/new`), fill in the form:

**Repository Name:** `Panam-Tunes`

**Description:** `Your Ultimate Free Music Player - Stream and download unlimited songs from around the world, completely free!`

**Visibility:** ✅ Public

**Initialize repository:**

- ❌ DON'T choose a license

(We already have all these files locally!)

Click **"Create repository"** button

### Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/kunallubhana/Documents/github first/Panam-Tunes"
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your repository will be live at:
**https://github.com/Kunallubhana77/Panam-Tunes**

## What Will Be Uploaded

✅ 13 files total:
- README.md with comprehensive documentation
- 5 professional screenshots
- App logo
- Demo video
- LICENSE (MIT)
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- .gitignore

## Troubleshooting

If you get an authentication error, GitHub might ask you to:
1. Sign in with your credentials
2. Or use a Personal Access Token instead of password

For Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Use the token as your password when pushing

**Everything is ready to go! Just create the repo on GitHub and push!** 🚀
